    Control Transfer Statements
	</h2>
	<p>
	There are 4 control transfer statements in Swift. 
	We have already looked at &#39;continue&#39; and &#39;break&#39;. 
	We looked at how we can use these to control the flow of execution in for, while and do while.
	</p>
	<p><B>continue</B></p>
	<p> 
	Usage of &#39;continue&#39; in all kinds of loops for, while and do while is covered in previous chapter. 
	Swift Chapter 12 Control Flow for, while and do-while
	</p>
	<p><B>break</B></p>
	<p>
	Usage of &#39;break&#39; in all kinds of loops has been covered in 
	Swift Chapter 12 Control Flow for, while and do-while
	</p>
	<p>&#39;break&#39; can also be used to exit the current switch block and start 
	execution after the closing brace of &#39;switch&#39; statement/block.
	</p>
	<p><B>fallthrough</B></p>
	<p>As discussed previously in the beginning of &#39;Switch&#39; explanation, 
	switch does not have the implicit fallthrough as with Objective-C, or C. 
	So in case you wanted to verify for the next case statement after the current case statement, 
	we use fallthrough keyword to avoid exiting switch block.
