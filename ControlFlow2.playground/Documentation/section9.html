	<B>return</B></p>
	<p>return passes the control from the current function to the calling function. 
	If the protocol is established to return a value from the called function, 
	it can return a value to the calling function or method. 
	This is discussed in more detail in a future chapter.

	<B>labeled statement</B></p>
	<p>The labeled statement addresses the issues with using control flow statements when 
	multiple loop structures are embedded within each other. 
	Like if a switch is embedded in a loop, if you wanted to break the flow using &#39;break&#39; statement, 
	depends on where the line is it may skip the current switch or for loop. 
	In order to be specific on which block to &#39;break&#39; or &#39;continue&#39;, 
	we can use labeled statements. As shown in the below example, we label our &#39;while&#39; 
	statement as &#39;fiveAndTenMultiple&#39;. Now when we make the call to the statement
	 &#39;break fiveAndTenMultiple&#39;, the compiler clearly knows that it needs to break the
	  flow for while loop and start executing the next line after the while block.
