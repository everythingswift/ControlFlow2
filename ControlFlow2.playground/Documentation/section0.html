		<h1>Swift Chapter 13 Control Flow if and switch</h1>
		
		<p>The second type of Control Flow in Swift is &#39;Conditional Statements&#39;. 
		The first is the if statement and the second is switch statement. The &#39;if&#39; statement is the 
		simplest to understand and is explained below through an example. The condition is evaluated to check 
		if the statements inside the if block should be executed.</p>
		<p>The below example checks if the age is greater than 16, if the condition does evaluate to true, then prints the line.
